# Unbricking

If after flashing the firmware and rebooting, you've waited a good 60s-90s and your device won't boot, you may need to unbrick it - a process which involves re-flashing the firmware using an external programmer.

::: tip
If you think your device is bricked, the quickest and easiest thing you can do is to perform a `Hard Reset` (AKA an EC Reset): press the `[Refresh+Power]` keys simultanenously, then release.
:::

There are serveral methods which can be used, though not all apply to all devices. All 2017+ models with a CR50 Google Security Chip (GSC) can be recovered with a SuzyQable.
